<h2>II.11 The Auxiliary Segment Option (COW Only)</h2>

Similar to the ‘long WA2 option’, the ‘auxiliary segment option’ is available for COW Functions 3 and 3C.  This option adds an additional 500 bytes to the COW WA2 output.  This option allows the user to request that, in the special case of a record that actually encompasses more than one segment, Geosupport will return the Segment IDs of all the segments (up to 70).
