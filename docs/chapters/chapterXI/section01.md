<h2> XI.1 Introduction  </h2>

Windows Desktop GOAT has been deprecated.  No updates to its functionality will be made.  It will continue to be available in the 32-bit Geosupport Desktop Edition only, not in the 64-bit version.  The data returned by GOAT will continue to reflect the data in the Geosupport release that came with the installation package; however, new fields that are added to Geosupport will not be added to GOAT.  

Geosupport On-Line Address Translator, commonly referred to as GOAT, is the systemâ€™s principal interactive Windows application. It is an inquiry application that allows the user to request almost any Geosupport Function. The user simply enters input data and receives a formatted screen display of the output information provided by that function. To use GOAT requires no programming skills and it is heavily used by non-technical people who need the information that GOAT can provide.
