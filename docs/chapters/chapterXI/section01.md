<u>Description of GOAT:</u>  
Geosupport On-Line Address Translator, commonly referred to as GOAT, is the systemâ€™s principal interactive Windows application. It is an inquiry application that allows the user to request almost any Geosupport Function. The user simply enters input data and receives a formatted screen display of the output information provided by that function. To use GOAT requires no programming skills and it is heavily used by non-technical people who need the information that GOAT can provide.
